Difficulties in the Dataset
Limited Sample Size:  While 1000 people is a good start, it might not be representative of the entire population, especially considering you only have 3 regions (Australia, UK, and AS - assuming AS is Asia). This could lead to biased results if you try to generalize the findings to a larger population.

Non-Binary Grouping: Grouping non-binary individuals into a single category might hide valuable insights about their specific social media habits or demographics.

Missing Information: The data doesn't specify the breakdown of social media usage (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) or how many people have each interest (sports, travel, lifestyle). This limits the analysis of specific platform preferences or correlations between interests.

Debt & Homeownership: There seems to be a slight discrepancy. With 164 people in debt, there are 166 homeowners, suggesting some homeowners might also be in debt. More information on mortgage status or debt type could clarify this.

Interesting Things to Explore
Does social media use differ between Australia, UK, and Asia? Are there preferred platforms in each region (e.g., higher Facebook usage in UK)?

Is there a connection between someone's interests (sports, travel, lifestyle) and the social media platforms they use? Do people with similar interests tend to congregate on specific platforms?

Is there a correlation between income, debt status, homeownership, and social media usage? Do people with higher incomes spend more time on social media, or vice versa?
Does social media usage differ between rural, suburban, and urban areas?  Do people in different locations gravitate towards specific platforms?
Is there a link between car ownership and social media use? Do car owners spend more time on specific platforms compared to those who don't?
